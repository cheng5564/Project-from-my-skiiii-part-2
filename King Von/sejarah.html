            <h2>King Von Story</h2>
            <p>Dayvon Dayquan Bennet, more commonly known as King Von,
                 was an American rapper born and raised in Chicago,
                 Illinois. Which is sometimes referred to as Chiraq for its similarities to Iraq in its murder rate and extremely high levels of gun violence.

                 He was born on the south side of Chicago and was raised in the Parkway Gardens Projects,
                  more commonly known as “O-Block.”
                  It’s located at the corner of 64th and Martin Luther King Drive and is also sometimes referred to as 300

                  Von grew up around other famous artists from O-Block such as Chief Keef and was childhood friends with rapper Lil Durk
                   who wasn’t from O-Block but was always closely affiliated with its members.

                   Growing up, Von was allegedly a member of the Black Disciples, or BD’s, 
                   street gang. And was given the nickname “grandson” because “When I was in jail… I reminded people of King David.” King David is referring to David Barksdale, the founder of the Black Disciples. He explained that in jail people said he reminded them of the gang leader in how he handled himself in the streets.
                   And also mentioned that people told him they shared a similar demeanor as well
